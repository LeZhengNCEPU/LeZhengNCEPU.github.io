## Research Interests

- Power System Stability and Control **电力系统稳定与控制**
- AI for Power System **人工智能在电力系统分析中的应用**


My current research interest focuses on addressing practical challenges in the development of the new type of power system with high penetration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), particularly related to stability analysis during system operation, dispatch, and control. I believe Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a crucial pathway to advancing these systems. I am committed to applying my experties to this meaningful field, contributing to societal well-bing through innovative solutions.
