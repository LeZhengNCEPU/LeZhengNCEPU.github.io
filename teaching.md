### 师者，所以传道受业解惑也。
I teach about how we understand the dynamics of power systems. In my classes, students work to have a glimps on how the power system behaves during and after disturbance, and how to control it. My students have opportunities to work with me on my research.

Discussion creates a broader awareness of the world around us. Take a class with me, and reflect on how we fit into that world while developing new skills for your future. Students in my classes are curious, hardworking, and open-minded. 

## Courses Taught

- **本科生专业核心课：电力系统分析(2)**

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].
